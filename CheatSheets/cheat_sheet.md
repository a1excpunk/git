# The perfect commit

1. Add the *right* changes
2. Compose a *good* commint message

<details>

<summary>Git command for partial add</summary>

```bash
git add -p <file name>
```

</details>

## The perfect commit *message*

1. `Subject` => concise summery of what happend (in terminal if you leave empty line after **subject** it will know that you are writing **body**.)
2. `Body` => more *detailed* explanation
    - What is now different than before?
    - What's the reason for the change?
    - Is there anything to watch out for anything particularly remarkable?

# Branching strategies

**A Written Convention:** Agree on a Branching Workflow in Your Team

1. **Git allows you to create branches** - but it doesnâ€™t tell you *how to use them*!
2. **You need a written best practice** of how work is ideally structured in your team - to avoid mistakes & collisions.
3. **It highly depends** on your team / team size, on your project, and how you handle releases.
4. **It helps to onboard new team members** ("this is how we work here").
